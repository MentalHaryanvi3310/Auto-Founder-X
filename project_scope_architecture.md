# AutoFounder X - Project Scope, Architecture, and Technology Stack

## 1. Project Goal

To create "AutoFounder X â€“ The AI Co-Founder That Never Sleeps," a fully autonomous AI platform that allows users to conceptualize, build, and launch startups with minimal human intervention. The core promise is: "You dream it, I build it."

## 2. Core Functionalities

### 2.1. AI Agents (14 Specialized Agents)

Each agent will have a specific role in the startup building process, with enhanced capabilities:

*   **Ideation Agent:** Mines various online sources (Reddit, HN, Twitter, GitHub, ProductHunt, indie tools) for trending ideas. **Upgrade:** Adds trend-graph visualization and Total Addressable Market (TAM) estimation.
*   **Validation Agent:** Automates market validation through auto-posting to Reddit/HN/Quora, running email tests, and polls. **Upgrade:** Creates waiting lists and heatmaps of interest.
*   **Product Agent:** Builds Minimum Viable Products (MVPs). **Upgrade:** Integrates third-party APIs (e.g., OpenAI, Stripe) for extended functionality.
*   **Design Agent:** Generates brand kits and UI/UX designs using Figma plugins and Midjourney. **Upgrade:** Converts UI designs to production-ready Tailwind/React components.
*   **Marketing Agent:** Develops marketing assets (landing pages, SEO copy, newsletters, X threads). **Upgrade:** Generates Veo-powered explainer videos and LinkedIn posts.
*   **Sales Agent:** Handles outreach and sales (cold emails, LinkedIn outreach, B2B onboarding funnels). **Upgrade:** Connects to free tiers of sales tools like Apollo, Instantly, or Lemlist.
*   **Analytics Agent:** Integrates Google Analytics, PostHog, and heatmaps. **Upgrade:** Auto-generates reports and growth recommendations.
*   **CRM Agent:** Tracks leads and manages users (Notion/HubSpot). **Upgrade:** Triggers AI email follow-ups.
*   **VC Agent:** Prepares for funding (pitch deck, AI-generated founder pitch video). **Upgrade:** Matches with VCs using Crunchbase free API.
*   **Launch Agent:** Automates product launches (ProductHunt, IndieHackers, X). **Upgrade:** Adds comment auto-replies and upvote tracking.
*   **Learning Agent:** Tracks project performance and iterates MVPs. **Upgrade:** Uses past failures to train future versions.
*   **Legal Agent:** Auto-generates legal documents (T&C, Privacy Policy, NDA, Freelancer Contracts). **Upgrade:** Utilizes open-source policy templates with GPT rewrite.
*   **Monetization Agent:** Recommends and implements revenue models (freemium, SaaS, e-commerce). **Upgrade:** Implements pricing pages and Stripe test plans.
*   **AI Integration Agent:** Recommends optimal LLMs (Claude, GPT, Gemini) per feature. **Upgrade:** Auto-creates API bridges and token setup.

### 2.2. Bonus Features

*   **MVP Marketplace:** A public marketplace for AI-built products, allowing users to upvote, clone, request features, or buy products.
*   **Co-Founder Clone:** AI replicates user's persona (tone, style, startup preference) from a 1-minute voice intro, enabling agents to build in their voice.
*   **Live Builder Mode:** Streams the building process in real-time, allowing users to watch agents work, intervene, and learn.
*   **Startup Battle Arena:** Users' AI-generated startups compete weekly with public leaderboards, vote-based funding credits, and a feedback loop for AI learning.

### 2.3. User Management & Data Persistence (Crucial Missing Features)

*   **User Authentication:** Secure sign-up and sign-in functionality.
*   **Project Persistence:** All created projects, their details, and progress must be stored and retrievable, associated with the creating user.
*   **Dashboard & Project Listing:** Users must be able to view their created projects and their statuses.

## 3. Architectural Overview

The system will follow a client-server architecture, with a clear separation between the frontend (web application) and the backend (API and agent orchestration).

    A[User] -->|Web Browser| B(Frontend: React App)
    B -->|API Calls (REST/WebSocket)| C(Backend: Flask Application)
    C -->|Database Operations| D(Database: SQLite/PostgreSQL)
    C -->|Agent Orchestration| E(AI Agent Modules)
    E -->|External APIs| F(LLMs, Third-party Services)
    E -->|Data Storage/Retrieval| D
```

## 4. Technology Stack

### 4.1. Backend

*   **Framework:** Flask (lightweight and flexible for API development).
*   **Database:** PostgreSQL (for robust, scalable data storage, replacing SQLite for production readiness). SQLite will be used for local development.
*   **ORM:** SQLAlchemy (for database interaction).
*   **Authentication:** Flask-Login, Flask-Bcrypt (for password hashing).
*   **Agent Coordination:** CrewAI (as suggested in the roadmap, for orchestrating AI agents).
*   **LLMs Integration:** `openai`, `anthropic`, `google-generativeai` Python libraries.
*   **Other Libraries:** `requests`, `python-dotenv`, `Flask-CORS`.

### 4.2. Frontend

*   **Framework:** React (as already started, for interactive UI).
*   **UI Components:** Shadcn/ui, Radix UI (for professional and accessible components).
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS.
*   **State Management:** React Context API or Zustand (for managing application state).
*   **API Communication:** Axios or native `fetch`.

### 4.3. Deployment & Hosting

*   **Local Development:** Python Flask development server, Vite for React development server.
*   **Production Deployment:** Docker (for containerization), Gunicorn/Nginx (for serving Flask app), Vercel/Render (for frontend hosting if separated, or combined with backend).

## 5. Development Phases (Refined)

1.  **Define Scope & Stack:** (Current Phase) Detailed planning of features, architecture, and technologies.
2.  **Backend Core Development:** Implement database, user models, authentication endpoints, and basic project CRUD operations.
3.  **Frontend Core Development:** Create sign-up/sign-in pages, user dashboard, and integrate with backend authentication.
4.  **Agent Integration & Logic:** Implement the logic for each of the 14 AI agents and integrate them with the project builder and dashboard.
5.  **Bonus Features Implementation:** Develop MVP Marketplace, Co-Founder Clone, Live Builder Mode, and Startup Battle Arena.
6.  **Comprehensive Testing:** Unit, integration, and end-to-end testing of all functionalities.
7.  **Packaging & Delivery:** Create a deployable package with clear instructions.
