## Todo List

- [ ] **Phase 1: Analyze existing project and requirements**
  - [x] Review `pasted_content.txt` for detailed project roadmap and features.
  - [x] Examine existing backend files to understand the current agent implementations.
  - [x] Examine existing frontend files to understand the current UI structure and identify missing components.
  - [x] Consolidate a comprehensive list of all required features, including authentication, data persistence, and all 14 AI agent functionalities.

- [ ] **Phase 2: Design complete system architecture**
  - [x] Design database schema for users, projects, and agent-specific data.
  - [x] Define API endpoints for user authentication, project management, and agent interactions.
  - [x] Outline frontend component structure and data flow.

- [ ] **Phase 3: Build robust backend with authentication and database**
  - [x] Set up Flask application with user authentication (registration, login).
  - [x] Implement database models using SQLAlchemy or similar ORM.
  - [x] Create API endpoints for user and project management.
  - [x] Implement basic API endpoints for each of the 14 AI agents (initially as placeholders).

- [x] **Phase 5: Integrate AI agent functionalities**
  - [x] Implement the core logic for each of the 14 AI agents.
  - [x] Integrate web searching, planning, and building capabilities as described in the roadmap.
  - [x] Ensure real-time updates and progress tracking are reflected in the frontend.

- [x] **Phase 6: Test all functionalities thoroughly**
  - [x] Test user registration and login.
  - [x] Test project creation and data persistence.
  - [x] Test all 14 AI agent functionalities end-to-end.
  - [x] Verify data integrity and error handling.

- [x] **Phase 7: Package and deliver complete solution**
  - [x] Create a single deployable package (e.g., Docker container or zip file).
  - [x] Provide clear deployment instructions.
  - [x] Deliver the complete, working solution to the user.
